3. **Progress**:
```sh
First, check how to use the git hub
Second, pick a topic
Third, role-sharing
Fourth, write the code and push, merge
Fifth, combining codes
Sixth, write a report
```

4. **Role sharing**:
```sh
Kim Jin-won: Write parts 2 and 3 of the report, make a model code, count how many people are wearing masks, and upload tensorflow files
Han Haram: Write part 1 of the report, code the preprocessing function, and count how many people are wearing masks and not wearing masks
Jiwoo Choi: Write part 4 of the report, code the predict function, capture people without masks and save image files
Heo Dong-hyuk: Write part 5 of the report, create a detection code, and capture people without masks and save image files
